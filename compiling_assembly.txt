Compiling and Linking an Assembly Program in NASM

Make sure you have set the path of nasm and ld binaries in your PATH environment variable. Now, take the following steps for compiling and linking the above program âˆ’

    Type the above code using a text editor and save it as hello.asm.

    Make sure that you are in the same directory as where you saved hello.asm.

    To assemble the program, type nasm -f elf hello.asm

    If there is any error, you will be prompted about that at this stage. Otherwise, an object file of your program named hello.o will be created.

    To link the object file and create an executable file named hello, type ld -m elf_i386 -s -o hello hello.o

    Execute the program by typing ./hello

If you have done everything correctly, it will display 'Hello, world!' on the screen.
